# SalmonLinuxServer
This is the GNU/Linux version of the volunteer server component of the Salmon
censorship circumvention system.

Salmon is released under the GPLv3.

The Release package comes bundled with SoftEther (https://www.softether.org/), 
which is released under the GPLv2.

To install from the Release package, extract, and run sudo ./install_salmon.sh.
This will install and configure both Salmon and SoftEther.

The installer has been thoroughly tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04. It should
work on any distro that has either update-rc.d or chkconfig, though.
